# Social Media app

A Social Media app is designed to connect users and allow them to share content, interact with each other, and stay up-to-date with the latest news, trends, and personal updates. It features profiles where users can share personal information, posts, images, and videos. The app includes a feed that displays posts from friends, followers, or public figures, as well as options to like, comment, and share posts. It allows messaging between users, creating groups, and following other users or pages of interest.
